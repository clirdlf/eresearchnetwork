##Instructions

For this exercise, select one of the three [Data Ethics Case Studies](http://www.datasociety.net/blog/2016/04/13/data-ethics-case-studies/) published by the Council for Big Data, Ethics, and Society. After reading through the case study, write a short response essay. The case studies pose specific discussion questions, which you may choose to address in your essay. You may also discuss the case study in more general terms. The following questions may be helpful to consider:
* Do you think that the authors of the case study sufficiently addressed the ethical challenges presented? Why or why not?
* Imagine that the authors of the case study are faculty at your university. How might you advise them?
* What questions do you have regarding big data ethics?
