For data or digital scholarship repositories, a data dictionary serves the following functions:
* To document the metadata elements used in the repository
* To define each metadata element
* To describe how each metadata element is assigned to repository content

For this exercise, we are asking you to build a data dictionary. You can either build one from scratch, OR you can conduct a metadata audit of your institutional repository (or a similar digital collection/repository) and then use that audit to create your data dictionary. There is an example data dictionary linked in the resources below. Some leading questions to consider as you put the data dictionary together:
* What are the minimum metadata fields that can viably describe your repository’s content? 
* Do some types of content need more metadata elements than others? 
* What information do those creating the metadata need to know in order to correctly and sufficiently describe your repository’s content?  
Feel free to use the [#assignments channel in Slack](https://eresearchnetwork.slack.com/messages/assignments/) to ask questions and talk through the assignment.

Resources:  
* Use the data dictionary example as a starting point - [Data Dictionary Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e0CnBViTMQ39pwVr8pWb8v51rCsICGAowP0FQcKsKUA/edit?usp=sharing)
* Use the FAIR Principles from Force11 and the w3c Data on the Web Best Practices as your guides
