Choose one of the following research case studies:

  * [Vitamin D for Bipolar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KEXPDEDE6698lEkW7MYZxtqUqM14z9XTYKaG2U2lslY/edit?usp=sharing)

Read through your case study of choice, imagining that the researchers described in the case study work at your university.  Using this [simple template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnMr-hMPfiET9hCRhzV-DSBsaLdgeNEOnqKVTQHYQ98/edit?usp=sharing), write a short data management plan for your case study. You can write in full paragraphs, or just create lists of bullet points. The goal is to clearly communicate your plans for organizing, describing, storing, protecting, sharing, and preserving the data. Please feel free to include institution-specific information such as information about your institutional data repository and institutional data policies. If you need to adjust the case study or exercise in any way to better fit your specific institution, please do so. This exercise is meant to provide practice for data management planning consultations, and to help think through potential difficulties in the data management planning process.
