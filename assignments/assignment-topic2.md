#Assignment 1

Due: June 14, 2017

##Directions

Submit to CLIR ERN OSF instance at <https://osf.io/pdn8z/>
  * Save the file with the following convention [assignment-one]-[institution-name].[file-extension]
  * Add the file to appropriate assignment folder in this [DLf-eRN-Assignments folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B00qDiMLT3XddXBOWWRZM1RISkk&usp=sharing)

For this exercise, we are asking you to pick between two options:

1. Create a Data Management Roadshow.
  * Craft a short slide deck (6 to 10 slides) explaining data management and data library services to your faculty senate or governing body (a group of researchers). An example roadshow is here - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14Qa8l5BONFtmXaTic88uvffnG-PO7OpDBIW_1ncxUX0/edit?usp=sharing

2. Create a Data Management Lesson Plan
  * Draft a single class lesson plan for undergraduate or graduate students. Take us through your goals, introduction of data management as a concept, and the exercises you will use to teach the session. An example lesson plan is here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e_Aekz8WKNXSgG3tUanW6Oo53hC2vIg9BB2yCCg3dNQ/edit?usp=sharing

The exercise you choose might depend on what is needed at your institution or what questions you have at this point in your data management program. Sara and I were thinking you might pick option 1 if you are just getting started with communication and option 2 if you wanted to focus more on teaching data management. We are also looking into matching partners for peer review to make sure everyone has the chance for feedback and workshopping.
