#Assignment 6

Due: November 2, 2016

##Directions

For data repositories, analytics can serve some of the possible functions:
* To show impact of the service or repository
* To assess where changes might be made to the service or repository
* To gather data that can be used in real-time features for the service or repository

For this exercise, we are asking you to analyze user behavior and web analytics from examples of statistics in a data repository. There is an example data analytics file linked in the resources below. Some leading questions to consider as you consider your assessment of the data:
* What are your objectives for the analytics data? 
* How do you need to present the data for your stakeholders?
