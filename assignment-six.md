#Assignment 6

Due: November 16, 2016

##Directions

For data repositories, analytics can serve some of the possible functions:
* To show impact of the service or repository
* To assess where changes might be made to the service or repository
* To gather data that can be used in real-time features for the service or repository
* To demonstrate how people use and interact wit the serive or repository

For this exercise, we are asking you to analyze user behavior and web analytics from examples of statistics in a data repository. There is an example data analytics file linked in the resources below. Some leading questions to consider as you consider your assessment of the data:
* What are your objectives for the analytics data? 
* How do you need to present the data for your stakeholders?

**Please answer the following questions for each data repository analytics log.**

Log 1 - Acquisitions data <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B00qDiMLT3XdczEtb1lsMm5RaWs/view?usp=sharing>
* Why do you think we are seeing the longer session duration coming from the "Referral" channel?
* Which channel would you focus optimization efforts on? Why? 

Log 2 - Behavior data <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B00qDiMLT3XdTzQyYzRQU3NHYzA/view?usp=sharing> 
* What do the low "Pages/Session" tell you about the user interface design of this repository?
* In comparing the pages with the most users (those with 5 users or more), what are the common success metrics that you see? Low bounce rates, high pages/session, longer session durations, etc.?

Log 3 - User data <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B00qDiMLT3XdZGZXQ0dOREdBMDg/view?usp=sharing>
* What are the most striking differences in behavior between "New Visitors" and "Returning Visitors"?
* Is there a particular metric you would like to see improved for "New Visitors"? Why?
