## **Course Description (Objectives, Goals, and Expectations)**

The DLF eResearch Network is a community of practice focused on implementing research data management and digital scholarship services and engaging in shared skill development, networking, and collaboration. In providing the eRN experience, DLF aims to create a self-reliant, mutually supportive community: a network of institutions and individuals engaged in continuous learning about research data management, digital scholarship, and e-research support.

**Overall Course Learning Objectives:**

* Build skills that will enhance local data services and digital scholarship support

* Develop a local strategic agenda for data services and digital scholarship support that is action-oriented and based in practice.

* Work on a consultation project that enables a deep dive into a local initiative or pressing question related to data services or digital scholarship.

* Connect with a community of practice engaged in program planning and deployment of data services and digital scholarship.

**Structure of the Course**

This year's eRN curriculum is designed to be flexible and adaptable. During our first eRN session, each participant will build an eResearch Services Roadmap that will help them identify learning goals and structure their work for the rest of the semester. Each subsequent month's meeting is assigned a broad topic, with each participant choosing an element of the topic that most benefits their goals. 

Each eRN session will consist of a short presentation from a topical expert and small group discussions. eRN participants will prepare for each session by completing a related assignment. The goal of eRN assignments is to help move a local initiative forward in a practical way; participants should design their assignments to fulfill their learning goals. This syllabus provides assignment ideas for each topic, and eRN faculty will also be available to provide feedback on alternative assignment ideas.
