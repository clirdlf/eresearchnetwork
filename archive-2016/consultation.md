#Consultation

Due: November 18, 2016

##Description

Consultations are optional sessions that give you a chance to look at a particular question that you want to solve locally. Consultants are E-Research faculty and associated experts such as CLIR/ DLF postdoctoral fellows in Data Curation or former E-Research participants. The level of each consultation is dependent on which areas of research data management an institution identifies, but sessions are limited to an hour.  We have outlined the current options for these optional consults below. 

 * **Workshop a document**. Your team provides a document that can be reviewed ahead of time: this might be something for public consumption, like an MoU template, a deposit agreement, or a typical DMP. The consultant reviews the document and schedules an hour-long call to discuss the document.

 * **Facilitate a discussion**. Your team puts together a set of questions or a problem that youâ€™d like to explore with an outside mediator/guide, and provide information on who will be invited to the consultation. This discussion takes place during an hour-long call, with time reserved for prep ahead of the meeting.

 * **Critique an interface or piece of documentation**. Your team provides links to something that needs an outside eye. This might be a repository interface, a website that explains services, or a piece of internally-focused workflow documentation. The consultant reviews the links and provides feedback during an hour-long call.

##Directions
Please choose one of the options above and let us know of your interest by **September 30, 2016 at 7pm EST**. We will work to match people with the consultants so that we have time for the consults in October and November 2016.
